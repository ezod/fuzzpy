                             FuzzPy - Release Notes

FuzzPy 0.4.2
    - improved intersection and union for fuzzy numbers
    - some bug fixes in graphs and fuzzy graphs

FuzzPy 0.4.1
    - support for Python 3
    - fuzzy number addition/subtraction
    - visualization support for all classes of fuzzy numbers
    - numerous internal improvements

FuzzPy 0.4.0
    - new plugin-based visualization framework
    - rework of IndexedSet class (improved correctness and performance)
    - major usability improvements to fuzzy set and graph classes
    - documentation generated from setup.py

FuzzPy 0.3.0
    - improved polygonal fuzzy number class
    - plotting module
    - various examples
    - switched to LGPL3 licensing

FuzzPy 0.2.3
    - polygonal and Gaussian fuzzy number classes
    - conversion from other fuzzy number types to polygonal

    - changed contents behaviour: mu = 0 means an element is not in a fuzzy set
    - mu-by-key method in fuzzy set class

FuzzPy 0.2.0
    - refactored fuzzy set class (new indexed set base class)
    - improved fuzzy number functionality
    - fuzzy set overlap
    - yager complement

FuzzPy 0.1.1
    - trapezoidal fuzzy number class
    - various Python-related improvements

FuzzPy 0.1.0
    - Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest path algorithm for fuzzy graphs
    - shortest path subgraph method for fuzzy graphs
    - various additional functionality for fuzzy graphs
    - unit testing module
